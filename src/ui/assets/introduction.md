### How to use this dashboard

#### 1. Feature Importance

Understand what drives an interest in science. Look at the bright yellow and dark blue squares 
in the correlation heatmap. Those indicate factors that are strongly correlated with each other. 
Explore these in more detail using the selection menus. Use this understanding to choose variables
that you think will be important in determining whether a student will continue in STEM. Test
these variables in the next section.

#### 2. Predictor

This is an opportunity to create a "student" and see how various factors impact their interest
in STEM. Choose the measurable you are looking to predict, choose the student's variables, then
experiment to what factors might boost an interest in STEM.

#### 3. Explore

Gain a better understanding of the data. This section allows you to explore some of the patterns
you see in greater detail, and to better understand the data behind the predictions.

### Dataset
This study employs public-use data from the 
[High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09)](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/). 
The goal of the study is to understand the factors that lead students to choose science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics courses, majors, and careers.

#### Important concepts

- *Self-efficacy*: this is a measure of a student’s confidence in a field – in this case, science, 
and has shown to be predictive of future success in that field.
- On top of this, we can use the psychological *expectancy value framework*, which connects certain 
values and beliefs with success in a field. We expect these measures to be strongly correlated 
with self-efficacy. These are:
  - *Identity* – the importance of a field to a person’s identity
  - *Utility* – the perceived usefulness of a field
  - *Cost* – the expected cost of pursuing a field, like time or expected stress
  - *Interest* – The intrinsic enjoyment a person gets from pursuing a field
