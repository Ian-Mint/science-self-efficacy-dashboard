Notes:
- Left: Feature importance can be viewed as a relative scale generated using the 
one-way [ANOVA test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_analysis_of_variance).
- Right: 
p-value is the probability that categories share the same mean in the dependent variable. 
Categories with p-values above the dotted line can be rejected as not predictive of the 
dependent variable. Categories with very small p-values are strongly predictive of the 
dependent variable.
