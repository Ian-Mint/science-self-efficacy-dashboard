## User Story

Our user: a secondary education policy-maker interested in boosting the number of students who choose STEM courses, majors, and careers after leaving high-school.
This user has a very clear, and measurable goal, but lacks direction. They do not have a concrete data-driven understanding of the factors that lead students to choose science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses, majors, and careers.

Our product will deliver much-needed insights to the user. After using our product, the user should be able to answer the following questions and more:
-	How does a teacher’s perceived attitude affect a student’s performance in STEM?
-	On what geographical regions should I focus my efforts?
-	What training can we give teachers?
-	What groups of students need extra focus?

Our user will be able to explore the data freely and intuitively. Their expertise in the field of education combined with the insights gained from our product will give their policies hard, data-driven direction.


## Dataset

This study employs public-use data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). One important difference
between HSLS:09 and previous studies is its focus on STEM education; one specific goal of the study is to gain an understanding of the factors that lead students to choose science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses, majors, and careers. 

Dataset can be downloaded by clicking: https://nces.ed.gov/EDAT/Data/Zip/HSLS_2016_v1_0_CSV_Datasets.zip

Steps:

    1. unzip Data/Zip/HSLS_2016_v1_0_CSV_Datasets.zip
    2. Change the name of the file 'hsls_09_school_v1_0.csv' to 'hsls_school_v1_0.csv'
    3. Change the name of the file 'hsls_16_student_v1_0.csv' to 'hsls_student_v1_0.csv'
    4. Move both the files to Data folder inside the project.

## How to use this dashboard

    1. Explore
        In this section, feel free to explore the distribution of data. We provide pie chart, xx chart, ...etc.

    2. Inspect
        We provide univariate analysis in this part. You can find how single variable affects your self-efficiency.

    3. Insights
        Multivariate statistical analysis can be found here, which helps you to gain insights on the data and provides advice for yourself.

## Summary
We analyse the data and observe interesting correlation between various student, school and teacher level variables with science self-efficacy. Each of the variables were chosen from a large list of variables available in the dataset based on interesting results and variables with significant correlation.

    1. At the student level, we consider student gender and choice of science course as indicators of science self-efficacy
    2. At the school level, we consider the school ownership, region of US and type of locality to analyse the science self-efficacy
    3. At the teacher level, we consider the affirmative attitude, teacher's gender and teacher's certification and study their impact on the science self-efficacy. 
    4. At the parent level, we consider the household income, parents' job status, degree earned, native english speaker family , confidence on college tuition and their impact on the science self-efficacy.
